<p>My name is Michael Paulmeno.  Currently I am the Head of Discovery Services for the Delta State University library, located in Cleveland, Mississippi.  Originally from New York City, I moved to the South after graduating with Masters Degrees in both Information Science and History in 2012.  Prior to that, I earned a Bachelors Degree in History from the University at Buffalo, SUNY in February 2008.<p/>  
<p>Getting to the present day required a roundabout journey.  Growing up my ambition was always to do something with science.  Maybe forensic science.  I'd seen it on TV after all.  But during my Sophomore year of High School I fell in love with history.  So when it came time to choose a major in college, history it was.  After four years, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in History in 2008.  Unfortunately that was the year the bottom fell out.  After two and a half years threading film projectors at a local movie theater, I decided to move on to graduate school.  My ambition was to become an archivist, but upon graduation (with student loans coming due) I saw a job posting for an Electronic Services Librarian position at Delta State University.  The rest, as they say, is history.</p>
