My name is Michael Paulmeno.  Currently I am the Systems Librarian for the Lucy Scribner library at Skidmore College, located in Saratoga Springs, New York.  Before taking my current position, I served for four years in a similar role at the Roberts-LaForge Library at Delta State University, in Cleveland, Mississippi.  Originally from New York City, I took my first full time library job after graduating with Masters Degrees in both Information Science and History in 2012.  Prior to that, I earned a Bachelors Degree in History from the University at Buffalo, SUNY in February 2008.

Getting to the present day required a roundabout journey.  Growing up my ambition was always to do something with science.  Maybe forensic science.  I'd seen it on TV after all.  But during my Sophomore year of High School I fell in love with history.  So when it came time to choose a major in college, history it was.  After four years, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in History in 2008.  Unfortunately that was the year the bottom fell out.  After two and a half years threading film projectors at a local movie theater, I decided to move on to graduate school.  My ambition was to become an archivist, but upon graduation (with student loans coming due) I saw a job posting for an Electronic Services Librarian position at Delta State University.  

Technology, as it turns out, was my true passion.  At Delta State, I learned the ins and outs of desktop support, systems librarianship, and systems administration.  After two years, my role changed to encompass supervision and management of the Serials and Interlibrary loan department.  Eventually, it came time to move on to bigger and better things.  So in the summer of 2017, I accepted my current position.
